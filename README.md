# Detailed HR Analysis

## Project Overview
This analysis aims to understand an organization's workforce better and make data-driven decisions. It contains a variety of information related to employees, recruitment, performance, and retention.

## Major Features

2. Employment Information: Job title, department, date hired and terminated help track employee tenure and departmental structure, facilitating workforce planning.
3. Compensation: Salary data allows for analysis of compensation trends, pay disparity, and financial forecasting.
4. Performance Metrics: Performance ratings and training hours enable evaluation of employee performance and the effectiveness of training programs.
5. Absenteeism: Tracking absences can help identify potential issues such as burnout or dissatisfaction within teams.
6. Employment Status: Understanding current employment status aids in retention analysis and identifying turnover rates.

## Tools
- Excel: For data cleaning and processing
- Postgresql: For data analysis
- Powerbi: Creating visualization
